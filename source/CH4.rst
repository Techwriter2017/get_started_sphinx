Chapter 4: Writing Collaboratively
==============================================
Technical writers are often employed by corporations and assigned to work on team to produce documentation.  
In these corporations, it is necessary for the writer to know how to collaborate with the team.  
When collaboration is done correctly, the documentation is better.

Our text book lists several advantages and disadvantages to collaboration.  With collaboration, 
the writer can draw upon a wider knowledge and skills base.  The documentation also benefits by having 
another person review it to make sure that it is accurate, clear, and targeted to the intended audience.  
Also, collaboration improves communication in the team, acclimates new writers, and improves moral.  
Collaboration does have disadvantages in time, interpersonal conflict, and other areas.  However, if 
the writer conducts themselves in a professional manner, the disadvantages of collaboration are manageable.

Documentation projects benefit from being planned and monitored through the process.  Before writing 
begins, it is advisable to create a documentation plan that lists what will be written, by whom, and 
contain a detailed schedule with milestones such as the date when the document will be drafted, reviewed, 
published, and so on.  Some documentation plans may include a list of risks or dependencies that detail 
the circumstances that impact successful completion of any and all milestones.  Also, if the documentation 
is being written by many writers, it is best to define individual tasks for each writer and establish a style 
sheet, a glossary as well as the work schedules and procedures to coordinate the teamâ€™s efforts.

In the career of technical writing, writers will have to attend many meetings.   To be successful, 
the writer should be prepared for the meeting with appropriate questions, listen effectively, and give 
feedback.  It is important to be professional and diplomatic when giving feedback.
Lastly, technical writers need to understand the various social media services available.  
For example:
* Videoconferencing as a way to meet and share information.
* Online information sources such as tweets, wikis, websites, Facebook, YouTube, and more.
* Different types of writing (aka authoring) software and online review.
