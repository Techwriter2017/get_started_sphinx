Chapter 6:  Researching Your Subject
=================================================

The main purpose of searching a subject is to get answers to questions.  You may need an answer to a 
practical question such as “Should tablets replace notebooks in the workplace?”.  Alternatively, you may 
need to answer scholarly questions. Whether you are searching for answers to practical questions or 
scholarly questions, your research will fall into two main types:


* Primary research—research where you discover or create the information yourself.

* Secondary research—you find information that other people have discovered or created.

Good research is planned.  The audience, purpose, and subject need to be analyzed to narrow down the 
scope of the project.  Budgets, time schedules and the form of the final documentation need to be worked out.  
You will essential to determine how much to research, how much research will actually be summarized in the 
document, and how much research is needed to provide you with enough background knowledge that you can 
understand and write to your audience.

Before you start researching, it is helpful to write out the questions that you need to answer.  
Then you will need to be persistent to find the answers to your questions.  You will want to have a system 
for recording or managing the information that you find.  Finally, you will want to make sure that you have 
triangulated the information.  That means that you found 3 different sources that answer the question in 
three different ways. 

You can find information in traditional form, online social media, or forms that you generate yourself:
     
* Traditional form includes print, online databases or catalogs, reference works, periodicals, newspapers, 
abstracts, and government information.   

* Online social media includes online discussion boards, wikis, blogs, tagged content, and RSS feeds. You 
will need to evaluate the information that you find for accuracy, bias, completeness, appropriateness, 
clarity, and timeliness.   

* Forms that you generate yourself include observations, field research, inspections, demonstrations (as 
 the case with software programs), interviews, questionnaires, inquiries, and surveys.
 
Regardless of where you get the research, it must be accurate and you must be honest in how you use it.
