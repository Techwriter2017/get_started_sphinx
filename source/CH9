Chapter 9: Emphasizing Important Information
=================================================

This chapter taught us about how to write so that important information is easily accessible 
and understood.  Here are some important points:

* Make sure that the titles and headings are informative.  The titles and headings should describe the 
section, and be indented id a way to highlight relative importance of the information.
* Separate out the important information into a list.  The list can have the important phases bolded 
and can have explanatory sentences following the bolded phrases.
* Structure paragraphs so that the important information comes first. Then, any supporting sentences 
can follow.
* Divide paragraphs into manageable chunks.  Find logical places to break paragraphs into fewer 
sentences so that there is not so much information for the reader to understand or remember.
* Use transitional word and phases to convey meaning.  Transitional words show relationships and 
include words like also, likewise, although, above,  and finally among many other words 
listed on page 209.
